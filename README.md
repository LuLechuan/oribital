# Project Orbital 2017: Creating a Maths PYP Web App

**Team ID**: CS with Maths 
 
**Proposed Level of Achievement**: Gemini 
 
**Target Audience**: All NUS students who are taking Maths modules 
 
## Motivation

### Problem 

Mathematical Society used to provide students who are taking maths modules with Past Semester Solutions: members from Maths Society write the full solutions for the past semester papers of each maths modules. These solutions provided are displayed using PDF files in which maths students can download from the offical website of Maths Society. However, one the one hand, it is very time consuming for one person to write out the answer for one complete paper. This results a difficulty in providing updated solutions. On the other hand, some students may prefer a hint of the solution instead of the full version. It is also tedious for students to search the one they want from a whole bundle of solutions. 
 
### Proposed solution 

Our team intend to create a website application for an easy provision and retrival of Maths solutions. To allowing easy edition on the solutions, as well as searching of solutions, the website would contain the solutions in the form of a tree, i.e. students can choose the path like "module" > "semester" > "question number" to get the solution they want quickly. 
For Maths Society members who want to add an answer for a particular answer, they can choose the question through the tree and write for the answer. Mathjax using LaTex will be provided so that members can write math equations directly. 
 
## Functionality 

### Maths Society Members: 
Write and edit solutions 

### Maths students: 
Search for solutions 
 
## Technical tools: 

**Node.js + MongoDB** for Website design

**Mathjax using LaTex** for typing of math equaltions 
 
## Plan:  

### June: 

**Week 1**: Confirmation of tools and data sources

**Week 2**: Launching of first prototype with minimum features â€“ Allowing uploading of solutions

**Week 3**: Building the function of writing maths equations using mathjax 

**Week 4**: Testing and debugging 

### July: 

**Week 1**: Building the function of dragging and dropping 

**Week 2**: Testing and debugging 

**Week 3**: Implementing advisors' and peer members' suggestions 

**Week 4**: Testing and debugging
