# Project Orbital 2017: Creating a Maths PYP Web App

**Team ID**: CS with Maths 
 
**Proposed Level of Achievement**: Gemini 
 
**Target Audience**: All NUS students who are taking Maths modules 
 
## Motivation

### Problem 

Mathematical Society provides students with Past Semester Solutions: members from Maths Society write the full solutions in Latex for the past semester papers of each maths modules. These solutions provided are displayed using PDF files in which maths students can download from the offical website of Maths Society. However, on one hand, it is very time consuming for one person to write out the answer for one complete paper, which results in the solutions not being updated. On the other hand, some students may prefer a hint of the solution instead of the full version. It is also tedious for students to search for the one they want from a whole bundle of solutions. 
 
### Proposed solution 

Our team intend to create a web application for an easy provision and retrival of Maths solutions. To allowing easy addition and searching of solutions, the website would contain the solutions in the form of a tree, i.e. students can choose the path like "module" > "semester" > "question number" to get the solution they want quickly. 
For Maths Society members who want to add an answer for a particular answer, they can choose the question individually via the tree and write the answer. Mathjax will also be provided such that Math equations gets displayed beautifully.
 
## Functionality 

### Maths Society Members: 
Write and edit solutions 

### Maths students: 
Search for updated solutions
 
## Technical tools: 

* **[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)** as main framework for development
* **[jQuery](https://jquery.com/)** for frontend development
* **[MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)** for backend development
* **[MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/)** as library for the display of math equations
 
## Plan:  

### June: 

* **Week 1**: Confirmation and learning of frameworks and libraries;

* **Week 2**: Launching of first prototype with minimum features â€“ Allowing addition, display, and editing of solutions in a single webpage;

* **Week 3**: Building the function of displaying Maths equations using MathJax;

* **Week 4**: Implement user registration and login; Testing and debugging;

### July: 

* **Week 1**: Building the tree like structure in the database;

* **Week 2**: Styling of front end with JQuery; 

* **Week 3**: Implementing advisors' and peer members' suggestions 

* **Week 4**: Testing and debugging
